This site is basicaly an advanced chat where instead of messages the players send each other notation for the next move. After each move the current board placement is showed on the display. There are private rooms for the players so that when you find a match noone will bother you. There are also lobbies which will be public for all the players in the LAN. There you can ask questions, see the current chess news or you can go to see the rules of playing chess. When you login into our website you will create a room for your own chess party. Also you will be able to see all the other available rooms to challange. When a party is started both your and your oponent`s rooms will not be visible for the other players.
